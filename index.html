        <img src="./assets/images/headshot.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid w-25 mr-4 mb-4 float-left ">
        <p>I am a Full-Stack web developer with the ability to pick up many different languages quickly. I graduated from Southern Methodist University with a certificate in Full Stack Web Development in 2019. After a rigorous 12 week program, I have become proficient in the following: git, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, Semantic UI, Materialize, node, oAuth, APIs, MySQL, Sequelize, MongoDB, ES5 & ES6, and React.js. 
        </p>
        <p>Prior to becoming a web developer, I was a teacher for Dallas ISD and a director at the University of Illinois at Chicago. My experience as a teacher developed my ability to manage many tasks at once and remain flexible since the needs of my students were constantly evolving. My experience as a director developed my knowledge of contracts, budgets, and managing many people as a direct manager. These skills prepared me to succeed as a web developer where the needs of the client are always evolving. My ability to manage multiple tasks have prepared me to lead in my project teams while my ability to remain flexible prepared me to fall back and allow others to also lead when applicable.
